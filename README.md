## Introduction

The client for this project is a cosmetics ecommerce company based in Russia. They have experienced flat growth over the past few months and have hired us to analyze their transactional data and implement Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) actions to reverse this situation.

 * [See a technical explanation of the project here](https://pabloelt.github.io/project/project3/)

## Objectives

The main objective is to analyze the transactional data to identify potential CRO actions that can increase visits, conversions, and average ticket size, thereby boosting the overall revenue of the ecommerce company. To achieve this goal, we will create advanced analytical assets such as:

* **RFM Segmentation:** Analyzing customer data based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value to identify key customer segments and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.
* **Recommendation System:** Developing a recommendation system to personalize the shopping experience, encouraging higher conversions and increasing the average ticket size.

These tools will help us implement effective CRO actions and drive substantial revenue growth.

## Project results

The main results obtained from this Discovery Project are summarized below:

**1. After analyzing the data, the baseline of the company has been found**
* In each session, on average:
  * 2.2 products are viewed.
  * 1.3 products are added to the cart.
  * 0.9 products are removed from the cart.
  * 0.3 products are purchased.
* Cross-selling: median of 5 products per purchase.
* Recurrence: 10% of customers repeat purchases after the first month.
* Conversion rates:
  * 60% from views to cart additions.
  * 22% from cart additions to purchases.
  * 13% from views to purchases.
* Average monthly revenue: 125.000€

**2. It is recommended to search for two-bedroom properties that can accommodate 4 guests**
* The number of guests that maximize the rental price while minimizing the property's purchase price is 4.

**3. It is recommended to search for properties in one of the identified neighborhoods that are not necessarily close to points of interest**
* These properties are expected to have a lower purchase price.
* It seems that proximity to points of interest does not have a particular impact on rental prices.
  
**4. A new business model based on rentals for specific moments of high sporting interest should be explored**
* It is advisable to look for opportunities in the San Blas neighborhood.
* These properties present a particularly high cost-income ratio per night.
* There are still many rentals that are not exploiting this potential.
